Requirements:
A html, css and js based local web app that can create a grid of images. Images can be imported using a file picker. I need to be able to arrange the images in a grid simply by selecting the size of each image and the size of each image in the grid. A cell can also be a text cell. I should be able to pick fonts from a wide list. Clarify any requirements that you might need.
